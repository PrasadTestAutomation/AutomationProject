# E-Commerce Automation Testing Framework

This is an automation testing framework built using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **Cucumber BDD**, **TestNG**, and follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern. It is designed to automate and validate the functionalities of the [Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com/) website.

This project serves both as a structured learning experience and as a demonstration of best practices in automation testing, version control, and code organization.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The framework currently covers the **Signup / Login feature**, verifying the entire registration flow, including account creation, validations, and navigation through the website.

As I progress, I will add more test cases covering end-to-end scenarios such as login, product browsing, checkout, and account management.

The main purpose of this project is to:
- Gain hands-on experience with automation tools and techniques
- Implement scalable and maintainable test automation code
- Showcase my skills through consistent GitHub commits and clean architecture

## âœ… Technologies Used

- **Java 8+** â€“ Programming language
- **Selenium WebDriver** â€“ Browser automation tool
- **Cucumber BDD** â€“ Behavior-driven development framework
- **TestNG** â€“ Test execution and reporting framework
- **Maven** â€“ Build and dependency management tool
- **Page Object Model (POM)** â€“ Design pattern for separating UI elements and logic
- **Git/GitHub** â€“ Version control and collaboration platform

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Prerequisites

- Install **Java 8 or higher**
- Install **Maven**
- Install **Google Chrome** or another supported browser
- Install **IntelliJ IDEA** or another Java IDE

---

### âœ… How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Build the project with Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the tests using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
   or by running the `TestRunner` class from IntelliJ

---

## âœ… Branching and Version Control

- The `main` branch holds the stable codebase
- Features are developed in branches like `feature/signup-login`
- Each feature branch focuses on specific functionalities
- Daily commits with descriptive messages are made to ensure progress tracking and code clarity

Example workflow:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/signup-login
git add .
git commit -m "Implement signup and login functionality"
git push -u origin main
```

## ðŸ“‹ Test Cases Implemented

### âœ… Test Case 1 â€“ User Registration Flow
- Launch browser and navigate to Automation Exercise
- Verify homepage visibility
- Click on Signup/Login
- Verify Signup form
- Enter user details (name, email)
- Click Signup
- Fill account information including Title, Name, Password, DOB
- Select newsletter and offers checkboxes
- Enter address details
- Click Create Account
- Verify account creation
- Click Continue
- Verify login success
- Delete account
- Verify account deletion

*(More test cases will be added in the coming days as I progress through the project.)*

---

## âœ… Best Practices Followed

âœ” Separation of locators and actions using Page Object Factory  
âœ” Business logic and validations kept in Page classes  
âœ” Step definitions are clean, readable, and reusable  
âœ” Meaningful commit messages and structured branching  
âœ” Assertions used to ensure test reliability  
âœ” Organized folder structure and code readability

---

## ðŸ“‚ Future Enhancements

- Add more end-to-end test cases such as:
  - Login with valid/invalid credentials
  - Product search and checkout process
  - Cart management
  - Account updates and deletions
- Integrate advanced reporting tools like Allure or ExtentReports
- Implement parallel execution and CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- Add data-driven tests and configuration management
